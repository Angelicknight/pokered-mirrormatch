# Pokémon Red and Blue Mirror Match Hack

This is Pokémon Red and Blue rom hack based on the awesome dissasembly project [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered). Simply, the hack forces every trainer battle to be a mirror match by copying the opponents party to yours.

It builds the following ROMs:

- pokered.gbc `sha1: 3a3ab0145027309870e54869f47bece45953ccea`
- pokeblue.gbc `sha1: 98e9a6f708966c187a98f893d15fe9f31e880f5c`
- pokeblue_debug.gbc (debug build) `sha1: fa475878aafb5c1e8f3e242affa12e14bc35efdd`

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
